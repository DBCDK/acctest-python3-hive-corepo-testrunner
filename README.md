# acctest-python3-hive-corepo-testrunner

## Testrunner for Search acceptance test for Hive and Corepo test cases

When running stand alone the package-name is taken from the current directory name

ie. `acctest-python3-hive-corepo-testrunner` will become `hive-corepo-testrunner-dbc` as the python module and `python3-hive-corepo-testrunner-dbc` as package name

When building using `Jenkinsfile` the `JOB_NAME` is used to determine package name.
And the packages are uploaded for `apt-get install`.

## Configuration

The `PACKAGE.ini` file contains segments (not a real ini file since no key-valye, but only segments)

 * `[version]`
    is the package version number (gets build-number attached)
 *  `[dependencies]`
    debian package names
 * `[description]`
    package title
 * `[long_description]`
    package description

## Directory layout

The directory structure is:

 * `src/`
  Where `.py` modules resides
   * test packages (named `tests`) are not included in the debian package
   * nosetest are run on the `tests` packages before the debian package is built
